		<p>Must Be The Holy Ghost (MBTHG) is the latest vehicle for North Carolina’s longtime sonic traveler Jared Draughon. Layered electronic rhythms fuse with thick looping guitars and soaring vocals, a sound both intricately crafted but with ever shifting landscapes.</p>
		
		<p>After fronting touring bands in Brooklyn, NY and Chapel Hill, NC for the last decade, Draughon moved to Winston-Salem, NC where he began his unorthodox approach to a solo project in 2012. MBTHG has since opened for various touring acts such as The XX, Torche, Whirr, He is Legend, Turquoise Jeep and William Tyler.</p>
		
		<p>Live MBTHG consists of Draughon on stage with various pedals and an array of different amps to pump out the countless sounds he builds with a guitar while interlacing tight drum loops. Within the limitations of loop music, Draughon manages to create unusually structured and complex songs with distinct movements, largely through his gift for melody. Impassioned vocals, often layered in multiple harmonies, draw you into a world that is far from constrained by the underpinning loops. MBTHG often teams up live with analog visual psych outfit Weapons of Mass Projection to unfold a narrative bathed in swirling colors.</p>
		
		<p>In April 2014 Durham, NC based label Cardigan Records released the debut album “Get Off” which showcases the loop-based art while still maintaining songs with emotional conviction.</p>
